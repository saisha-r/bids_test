# `eeg`

The `eeg` folder should store the original data files as saved by the EEG acquisition system. If the data have to be converted to another format prior to being readable by `mne-bids` (i.e., ANT data need to be converted to EEGLAB format in Matlab), the result of that conversion should *also* be stored here in `sourcedata/sub-00x/eeg`.
